# string / string / S
A string of characters. Ended by a 0 symbol. The 8 bytes before the string are the length of the string. This length can be retrieved by via a method. A string can not be longer than 2^64, because it is the maximum addr. of a 64 bit pointer system. If the length of a string can not be retrieved from a native string, it is set to 2^64 or String.ERROR_LENGTH. You need to check this only if you retrieve it from a native string, other than that you do not need it. If you don't know what a native string is, you don't need to check it. (A native string is a string produced by a C / C++ / Assembly-Language or any other Low Level Programminglanguage, that build string without storing the length externally.)
